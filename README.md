# Beamu's Volume Meter
A real-time desktop decibel meter with a fun twist — if you get too loud, you'll be visually and audibly punished! 😈
Built with CustomTkinter, PyAudio, and Pygame.

# 📁 Folder Setup
Make sure the following folders exist in the same directory as your script:
```
volume-meter/
├── Images/     # Put punishment images here (.jpg, .png)
├── Sounds/     # Put punishment sounds here (.mp3)
├── Beamu's VolumeMeter.exe
```

✅ Image Rules:
- Place any .jpg, .png, or .jpeg image files inside the Images/ folder.
- The app will choose one randomly when the threshold is exceeded.

✅ Sound Rules:
- Place any .mp3 sound files inside the Sounds/ folder.
- The app plays one randomly during penalty.
